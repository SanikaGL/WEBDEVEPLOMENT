Excellent question 🔥 — this is exactly how to think like a JavaScript developer. You’re asking about what happens in the flow when an error is thrown and how the try-catch block interacts with it.

Let’s go step by step — line by line, in a super clear way 👇


---

🧠 First, the code you’re talking about

let a = prompt("Enter first number");
let b = prompt("Enter second number");

if (isNaN(a) || isNaN(b)) {
  throw SyntaxError("Sorry this is not allowed");
}

let sum = parseInt(a) + parseInt(b);

try {
  console.log("The sum is ", sum * x);
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Error aa gaya bhai");
}


---

⚙ Step 1: Code executes top to bottom

JavaScript always executes line by line — unless an error is thrown.


---

🧩 Step 2: User input

let a = prompt("Enter first number");
let b = prompt("Enter second number");

➡ Suppose user enters:

a = "5"

b = "hello"



---

🚨 Step 3: The if condition

if (isNaN(a) || isNaN(b)) {
  throw SyntaxError("Sorry this is not allowed");
}

isNaN(a) checks if a is Not a Number
→ "5" is a number → false

isNaN(b) checks if b is Not a Number
→ "hello" is not a number → true


So the condition becomes false || true → ✅ true

That means the code inside the if block runs.


---

💣 Step 4: The throw keyword

throw SyntaxError("Sorry this is not allowed");

💥 When JavaScript sees throw, it stops the normal flow immediately.
It creates an error object (SyntaxError here) and throws it — meaning:

> “I can’t continue. Someone must handle this error.”




---

🧱 Step 5: What happens next?

As soon as an error is thrown:

JavaScript stops executing the rest of that function or script

It starts looking for a try...catch block to handle the error


Now in your code:

The throw happens before the line let sum = ...

So the interpreter never reaches the sum line.

It also never reaches the try-catch block, because the error was thrown before it.


So, nothing after throw runs.


---

🔍 In short:

Line	Executes?	Explanation

let a = prompt()	✅	Runs
let b = prompt()	✅	Runs
if (isNaN(a)		isNaN(b))
throw SyntaxError(...)	✅	Error thrown
let sum = parseInt(...)	❌	Skipped (error already thrown)
try { ... }	❌	Not reached (error outside try)



---

⚙ Step 6: What if throw was inside the try block?

Let’s move the error-throwing inside the try:

try {
  let a = prompt("Enter first number");
  let b = prompt("Enter second number");

  if (isNaN(a) || isNaN(b)) {
    throw SyntaxError("Sorry this is not allowed");
  }

  let sum = parseInt(a) + parseInt(b);
  console.log("The sum is", sum);

} catch (error) {
  console.log("Error aa gaya bhai");
}

Now the flow is different:

1. JS runs try block line by line.


2. When it hits throw, it stops right there.


3. It jumps to catch, skipping the rest of the try.


4. Inside catch, error will hold the thrown error object.



✅ Output:

Error aa gaya bhai

And after that, if there’s more code below the catch, it will continue normally.


---

🧩 Step 7: What is error in catch(error)?

That error is just a variable name, like x or msg.
JavaScript passes the actual error object into it automatically.

Example:

try {
  throw new SyntaxError("This is wrong!");
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err.name);    // SyntaxError
  console.log(err.message); // This is wrong!
}


---

🧠 Step 8: Summary of “throw” behavior

Keyword	Meaning

throw	Stops code and throws an error object
try	Code to attempt running
catch(error)	Handles any thrown error
error	Variable holding the error object
After catch	Code continues normally



---

⚙ Simple visual flow:

try {
   code...
   throw Error()
   code after throw ❌ (skipped)
}
catch(error) {
   handle error ✅
}
code after catch ✅ (runs)


---

✅ So, your answer:

> When an error is thrown (using throw), JavaScript stops executing the current block immediately.
If the throw is not inside a try, the program stops completely.
If it’s inside a try, the control jumps to the catch block, skips the remaining lines inside try, and continues after catch.

Would you like me to add this try-catch explanation also to the big summary you saved before — so your notes have Promises + Async/Await + Fetch + Try-Catch + Throw all in one place?
