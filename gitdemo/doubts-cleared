Excellent — you’re asking at the **perfect stage** of learning Git 👏

Let’s break down that image step by step clearly so you understand what those `git config` commands are doing.

---

## 🧩 Step 1: What does “config” mean in Git?

The command

```
git config
```

is short for **“configure Git settings.”**
It’s how you tell Git about **your name, email, editor, etc.** — information Git needs to record with every commit.

When you make a commit, Git stores:

```
Author: Your Name <youremail@example.com>
```

So Git needs to know who you are — that’s what we set using `git config`.

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: Meaning of the commands in the image

### 🟢 1️⃣ Set your name

```bash
git config --global user.name "My Name"
```

* `git config` → command to change settings
* `--global` → means “apply this for **all repositories** on this computer”
* `user.name` → setting the “author name” that will appear in commits
* `"My Name"` → replace this with your real name

So now Git knows your name when it saves a commit.

---

### 🟢 2️⃣ Set your email

```bash
git config --global user.email "someone@email.com"
```

* `user.email` → sets the email linked to your commits
* Should usually be the same email as your **GitHub account** (so commits link properly online).

---

### 🟢 3️⃣ Check your settings

```bash
git config --list
```

This shows all the Git configuration values currently set —
you’ll see something like:

```
user.name=My Name
user.email=someone@email.com
```

---

## 🧠 Step 3: What does `--global` mean?

Git can store settings in **three levels**:

| Level       | Scope                         | Description                                    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `--system`  | For all users on the computer | Stored in system config (rarely used)          |
| `--global`  | For your user account         | Stored in your home folder (affects all repos) |
| *(no flag)* | For one specific project only | Stored inside that repo’s `.git/config`        |

So:

* `--global` → sets values that apply **everywhere**
* No flag → sets only for **that one project**

---

### 🧩 Example:

Let’s say:

* You work on two projects: `app1` and `app2`
* You run `git config --global user.name "Sanika"`

✅ Then both `app1` and `app2` will use `"Sanika"` as the author name automatically.

If you want **a different name or email** for just one project:

```bash
git config user.name "Project Name"
```

(without `--global`) — it only affects that single repo.

---

## 🔍 Step 4: Where does Git store this info?

When you run `--global`, Git stores your name and email in a file:

```
~/.gitconfig
```

You can open this file (with Notepad or VS Code) and see:

```ini
[user]
    name = My Name
    email = someone@email.com
```

---

### 🧠 In short:

| Command                                            | What it does                      |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`        | Set your name for all repos       |
| `git config --global user.email "you@example.com"` | Set your email for all repos      |
| `git config --list`                                | Check what’s currently configured |

---

Would you like me to show how the **commit message will look** before and after setting your name/email (so you can see why this config matters)?

//
//
global means what?
That’s an *excellent question* 🙌 and you’re absolutely right to stop and understand this deeply — because this “global” thing is **confusing at first** if you’re just starting out.
Let’s go **step by step**, super simple and clear — no assumptions, no jargon.

---

## 🧩 Step 1: What “git config” really does

When you install Git, it needs to know **who you are** — your name and email — so that when you make changes and save versions (commits), Git can record:

> “This change was made by Sanika [sanika@email.com](mailto:sanika@email.com)”

That’s all this setup is for — to let Git *sign your commits* with your name and email.

---

## 🧠 Step 2: Where Git stores this information

Git can store your name/email in **three possible places (levels):**

| Level      | Command                      | Where it's stored                      | Applies to                          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **System** | `git config --system ...`    | Whole computer (for all users)         | Rarely used                         |
| **Global** | `git config --global ...`    | In your **user account** (home folder) | For **all repos you create or use** |
| **Local**  | `git config ...` *(no flag)* | Inside **one project folder**          | Only for that one repo              |

---

## 🧩 Step 3: What “--global” means in plain words

When you write:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Sanika"
git config --global user.email "sanika@email.com"
```

It means:

> “Hey Git, whenever I create or use *any Git repository* on this computer,
> use this name and email by default for my commits.”

---

### 🚫 It does **NOT** mean:

* Git will start tracking all your folders. ❌
* Git will access every folder or file. ❌
* Git will make every folder a repository. ❌

---

### ✅ It means:

Git just **remembers your identity** globally —
so that whenever you start using Git in *any folder* (like `git init`),
it already knows who you are.

It’s like setting your name once in your phone —
you don’t have to type your name again when sending messages from different apps.

---

## 🖥️ Example:

Let’s say your computer has these folders:

```
Documents/
│
├── Folder1/
│     ├── randomfile.txt
│
├── MyWebsite/
│     ├── index.html
│     ├── script.js
│
└── SchoolNotes/
      ├── notes.docx
```

Now, you install Git and run:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Sanika"
git config --global user.email "sanika@email.com"
```

✅ What happens:

* Git stores your name/email in a file inside your **home directory** (not in these folders).
* Nothing changes in Folder1, MyWebsite, or SchoolNotes.
* Git is **not tracking anything yet**.

---

## 🧩 Step 4: When does it actually apply?

Later, suppose you go inside **MyWebsite** folder and run:

```bash
git init
```

Now this folder becomes a Git repository.

When you make your first commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
```

Git will use:

```
Author: Sanika <sanika@email.com>
```

Because you set that globally before.

You didn’t have to set it again!

---

## 📁 Step 5: What if I want a *different* name/email for just one project?

You can override the global setting like this:

```bash
git config user.name "Sanika College"
git config user.email "college@email.com"
```

⚡ (Notice: no `--global` here)
That means this name/email will apply **only for this one project**.

---

## 💡 Analogy

Think of it like this:

| Thing              | Example                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Global setting** | You set your name on your computer → all apps know it (default)                     |
| **Local setting**  | You change your name inside one app only (like Zoom) → only Zoom uses that new name |
| **No setting**     | If you never set your name, apps won’t know who you are                             |

---

## 🔍 Step 6: How to see where Git saved it

If you run:

```bash
git config --list
```

You’ll see something like:

```
user.name=Sanika
user.email=sanika@email.com
```

And if you check your home folder (on Windows, `C:\Users\<yourname>\`),
you’ll find a file named:

```
.gitconfig
```

Inside that, Git saved:

```ini
[user]
    name = Sanika
    email = sanika@email.com
```

That’s what `--global` did — it just wrote this info here.

---

### 🔊 **In summary (super simple version):**

* `--global` = remember my name/email for all future Git projects on this computer
* It doesn’t track your folders
* It doesn’t give Git access to your files
* It just saves your identity as the “author” of commits

---

Would you like me to draw a **simple diagram** that shows:

* your computer folders,
* where Git saves global config,
* and how it applies when you initialize a Git repo?

It’ll make this crystal clear visually.

------>>>>>  HOW TO USE GIT BY OPENING FILE DOUBT??????
💯 Exactly right! You got it perfectly — and that’s a *very* important concept to understand early.
Let’s break it down clearly again so you know **exactly what’s happening when you do that.**

---

## 🧭 Step-by-step explanation

### 🪶 Step 1: You open Git Bash

You can open Git Bash anywhere, but let’s say right now it opens in your home directory:

```
C:\Users\Sanika>
```

---

### 🪶 Step 2: You “go inside” your project folder

You use the `cd` (change directory) command to move into the folder where your project lives.

Example:

```bash
cd Documents/MyWebsite
```

Now your prompt will show something like:

```
C:\Users\Sanika\Documents\MyWebsite>
```

✅ That means: *you’re now “inside” the MyWebsite folder.*

---

### 🪶 Step 3: You create a Git repository **in this folder**

You run:

```bash
git init
```

Git will say something like:

```
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Sanika/Documents/MyWebsite/.git/
```

💡 That means Git just created a hidden folder named `.git` inside `MyWebsite`.
That’s where Git stores **all version history and settings** for *this specific project only.*

---

### 🪶 Step 4: Now Git is *active* for this folder

From now on, when you’re inside `MyWebsite` and type Git commands (like `git add`, `git commit`, `git status`),
Git knows you’re talking about *this project only* — because of that hidden `.git` folder.

It won’t affect your other folders like `Documents/Folder1` or `SchoolNotes`.

---

### 🪶 Step 5: You can start tracking files

For example:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial version of my website"
```

Now Git saves your website files’ current versions.
And the “author” info (your name and email) comes from your **global config** unless you override it locally.

---

### 🧩 So in simple words:

| What you do                | What it means                                            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git init` inside a folder | “Make *this folder* a Git project.”                      |
| `git add` / `git commit`   | “Track and save versions of files *inside this folder*.” |
| `git config --global ...`  | “Remember my name/email for all projects.”               |
| `cd` command               | “Move to the folder where I want to run Git commands.”   |

---

### 🪄 Example walkthrough

Let’s visualize:

```
Documents/
│
├── MyWebsite/   ← you open Git Bash here and type `git init`
│     ├── index.html
│     ├── style.css
│     └── script.js
│     └── .git/   ← Git creates this hidden folder automatically
│
└── Folder1/
      ├── randomfile.txt
```

👉 Only **MyWebsite** becomes a Git repository.
👉 **Folder1** remains a normal folder — Git doesn’t touch it.

---

Would you like me to show you a **simple diagram** (like a visual flow) of what happens when you `cd` and `git init`, including that hidden `.git` folder? It makes this even easier to visualize.
