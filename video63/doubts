🧠 First: What var, let, and const actually mean

Keyword	Scope	Reassignment	Redeclaration	Hoisting

var	Function-scoped	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	✅ Hoisted (value = undefined)
let	Block-scoped ({ })	✅ Yes	❌ No	✅ Hoisted (but not initialized)
const	Block-scoped ({ })	❌ No	❌ No	✅ Hoisted (but not initialized)

🧩 Now, when it comes to arrays or objects

Here’s the key idea:

> const prevents reassignment of the variable, but does not make the contents (array or object) immutable.



That means the reference to the array cannot change, but the data inside it can still change.

Let’s see examples:


---

1️⃣ Using var

var arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4);      // ✅ Works — modifies array
arr = [9, 8, 7];  // ✅ Works — reassigned new array

console.log(arr); // [9, 8, 7]

✅ You can modify contents
✅ You can reassign
⚠ But var is function-scoped, meaning it can cause bugs in large codebases due to hoisting.


---

2️⃣ Using let

let arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4);      // ✅ Works — modifies array
arr = [9, 8, 7];  // ✅ Works — reassigned new array

console.log(arr); // [9, 8, 7]

✅ You can modify and reassign
🚫 You cannot redeclare it in the same block:

let arr = [1, 2, 3];
let arr = [4, 5, 6]; // ❌ Error: Identifier 'arr' has already been declared


---

3️⃣ Using const

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4);      // ✅ Works — modifies array contents
arr[0] = 99;      // ✅ Works — modifies element

arr = [9, 8, 7];  // ❌ Error: Assignment to constant variable

💡 The variable arr is constant, but the array it points to is still mutable.
So:

❌ You can’t reassign the variable.

✅ You can modify what’s inside the array.



---

🎯 Think of it like this:

Keyword	Can change array contents?	Can reassign to new array?	Example

var	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	var arr = [1]; arr.push(2); arr = [3];
let	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	let arr = [1]; arr.push(2); arr = [3];
const	✅ Yes	❌ No	const arr = [1]; arr.push(2); arr = [3]; // Error



---

💬 In short:

Use let when you expect to reassign the variable (like swapping arrays, counters, etc.)

Use const for arrays and objects that shouldn’t be reassigned, only modified inside.

Avoid var in modern JavaScript (it’s old and confusing with scoping).



---

🧩 Example to visualize the difference:

// Using let
let numbers = [1, 2];
numbers.push(3);  // ✅ works
numbers = [4, 5]; // ✅ works
console.log(numbers); // [4, 5]

// Using const
const values = [1, 2];
values.push(3);   // ✅ works
values = [4, 5];  // ❌ Error: Assignment to constant variable

Would you like me to also show a diagram of how const keeps the reference fixed but allows content modification (like a box with a pointer)? It helps you see how memory behaves.
