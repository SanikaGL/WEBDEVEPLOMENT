🌐 1. alert(), confirm(), prompt()

💬 Real-world use:

Modern sites rarely use native alerts (they look old-fashioned), but they serve the same purpose — user confirmation or warnings.

Example:

When you click “Delete account” on a website like Gmail → it asks “Are you sure?” (That’s a styled version of confirm().)

Many small admin dashboards or college projects still use:

if (confirm("Do you really want to delete this record?")) {
    deleteRecord();
}


Why BOM:
Because these functions belong to the browser window (window.alert, etc.) and are used to pause execution and get a quick answer from the user.


---

📍 2. location Object (URL Handling)

💡 Real-world use:

Used whenever a site redirects or reloads a page.

Examples:

After login, many sites do:

location.href = "/dashboard.html";

or use:

location.replace("/home");

Payment sites like Paytm or Razorpay redirect you using location.assign() to another secure page.


Why BOM:
Because redirection and URL navigation are browser-level actions, not part of the HTML document.


---

🧭 3. navigator Object (Browser & System Info)

💡 Real-world use:

Used for device detection, PWA (Progressive Web App) features, and user analytics.

Examples:

When you visit YouTube offline, it shows “You’re offline” — uses:

if (!navigator.onLine) showOfflineMessage();

Some sites adjust UI for iPhones/Android:

if (navigator.userAgent.includes("iPhone")) {
    // Apply iOS-specific layout
}


Why BOM:
Because navigator gives information about the browser, OS, and network, which only the browser environment knows.


---

⏪ 4. history Object (Navigation)

💡 Real-world use:

Single-Page Applications (SPAs) like React, Angular, and Vue apps use history.pushState() to change the URL without reloading the page.

Examples:

In Gmail or YouTube, when you click different sections, the URL changes (/inbox, /watch?v=...) but the page doesn’t reload. That’s because they use:

history.pushState({}, '', '/inbox');

and then load content dynamically.


Why BOM:
Because the browser history is managed outside the page DOM — part of the window environment.


---

🖥 5. screen Object (Device Screen Size)

💡 Real-world use:

Used for responsive design or positioning pop-ups.

Examples:

Netflix or Amazon Video centers a pop-up player window:

let left = (screen.width - 800) / 2;
let top = (screen.height - 600) / 2;
window.open('player.html', '', width=800,height=600,left=${left},top=${top});

Mobile web apps detect small screens to adjust layout or redirect to mobile versions.


Why BOM:
Because the screen dimensions belong to the device, not the web page.


---

🪟 6. window.open(), window.close(), setTimeout(), setInterval()

💡 Real-world use:

When you click “Login with Google,” a new small pop-up window appears → uses window.open().

Online exams or chat widgets sometimes auto-close windows → window.close().

Countdown timers (like payment portals: “You have 2 minutes left”) → setInterval() (also part of window).


Example:

let timer = setInterval(() => {
  console.log("Timer running...");
}, 1000);

Why BOM:
Because these control the browser tab/window behavior and timing in the environment.

🧠 7. How All Fit Together on a Real Website

Let’s imagine a real example — an online shopping website (like Amazon):

Page Feature	BOM Used	Purpose

Login redirect	location.href	Move to dashboard after login
“Add to Cart” confirmation	confirm()	Ask user to confirm action
Detect offline status	navigator.onLine	Show “You are offline” message
Responsive pop-ups	screen.width, screen.height	Center or resize pop-up window
Change URL without reload (React SPA)	history.pushState()	Navigate products smoothly
Auto-refresh offers	setInterval()	Update countdown timers



---

💻 8. Where in Code (script.js)

All BOM code sits in your front-end JavaScript file, connected to HTML:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Shop</title></head>
<body>
  <button id="buyBtn">Buy Now</button>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

script.js:

document.getElementById("buyBtn").onclick = function() {
  if (confirm("Confirm purchase?")) {
    alert("Purchase successful!");
    location.href = "/order-summary.html";
  }
};

window.addEventListener('online', () => alert("You're back online!"));
window.addEventListener('offline', () => alert("You are offline!"));

All the above functions (confirm, alert, location, navigator) are BOM features running inside the browser.

✅ Summary:

BOM Object	Real Website Example	Use Case

alert() / confirm()	Delete confirmation dialogs	Get user confirmation
location	Redirect after login or payment	Change page URL
navigator	Offline detection on YouTube	Detect browser info
history	SPA navigation (React, Gmail)	Change URL w/out reload
screen	Centered pop-ups	Handle device size
window.open()	Login with Google pop-up	Open new window
setInterval()	Countdown timer	Schedule repeated actions

Would you like me to show a small real-world demo website (like a “mini shopping site”) using all these BOM features together — so you can see how real sites combine them in one project?
